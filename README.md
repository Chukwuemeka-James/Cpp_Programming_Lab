# C++ Learning Journey

Welcome to my **C++ Learning Journey** repository! This is a collection of notes, code examples, exercises, and resources that Iâ€™m creating to help myself and others learn C++ for Machine Learning. 

**Motivation**: I noticed that there isnâ€™t much content available online for C++ in the context of Machine Learning. To address this gap, I plan to update and enhance this repository as I progress in my learning journey, making it a valuable resource for anyone interested in C++ programming and its applications in ML.

## What will be Included?

This repository is organized to help you progress step-by-step in C++ programming, starting from the very basics and moving toward more advanced topics.

1. **Introduction to C++**
   - What is C++?
   - Setting up the development environment
   - Basic syntax and structure

2. **C++ Fundamentals**
   - Data types and variables
   - Input and output in C++
   - Operators and expressions
   - Control structures (if-else, switch, loops)
   - Functions and modular programming

3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts**
   - Introduction to classes and objects
   - Constructors and destructors
   - Inheritance and polymorphism
   - Encapsulation and abstraction

4. **Memory Management in C++**
   - Pointers and dynamic memory
   - Smart pointers
   - Memory leaks and how to avoid them

5. **Standard Template Library (STL)**
   - Vectors, lists, and other containers
   - Iterators
   - Algorithms and sorting

6. **Advanced Topics**
   - Lambda functions
   - Templates and generic programming
   - Exception handling
   - Multithreading in C++

7. **Project-Based Learning**
   - Mini projects to solidify concepts
   - Working with files
   
8. **ML Projects**
   - Building ML projects
   
9.  **C++20 Features**
   - Concepts
   - Ranges
   - Coroutines
   - Modules

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of the Repository

The goal of this repository is to provide a clear, structured path for learning C++, especially for people who are interested in Machine Learning Engineering.
